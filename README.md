Hi! I'm Michael Reed a Junior Web Developer based in California, United States. My main area of expertise is Creative Front-end Development with React, ThreeJS and WebGL.

I've recently learned how to program of my own accord. I love the idea of creating unique user experiences through cutting edge technology!

This website's purpose is to serve me as a Resume and Portfolio, and I made it with React!
